# E-Commerce Backend 

  ## Description
  This repository contains code that builds the backend for an E-Commerce Website. Using ExpressJS and Sequelize, a database is created and seeded with a variety of different products, categories, and product tags. The user can view all products, tags, or categories in full, view each product, category, or tag by ID as well as add a new product, category or tag. Users can also update a category, product or tag by its ID or if they'd like, they can also delete each one by its ID.

  You may need to login into MySQL in order to create the database. To do this, follow these steps: 

  1. In the terminal, run the command "mysql -u root -p". You will be prompted to enter the password. The password is "rootroot".
  2. Once logged in, create the database by running the command "source /db/schema.sql".
  3. Once the database is created, run "quit", which will close the MySQL CLI. 

  To seed the database you just created, run the command "npm run seed"

  Start the server by running "node server.js"
